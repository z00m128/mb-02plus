patchimages.sh
--------------

HDD bios needs images of exact size (2MB) and geometry. There are two versions of it - 8 sectors per track and 11 sectors per track.

If you have disc images with 8x128 geometry (used mainly with EasyHDD), use the 8sec/trk version of BSDOS/HDD BIOS.

If you have disc images with different size/geometry you can use image patcher to create new set of images, with 11x93 geometry.

Sorry Windows users, this is for Linux / MacOS users only.
