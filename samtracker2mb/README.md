## Sample Tracker 2 with MB-02+ extension

**Make no mistake, this is not the source of the Sample Tracker 2 itself!** This is my old lame MB-02+ extension patch for Sample Tracker 2, reworked from Prometheus era to modern days. So you can build it on your PC.

### Requirements

- _[SJAsmPlus](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus/releases)_ cross assembler
- _ZX7_ data compressor by Einar Saukas
