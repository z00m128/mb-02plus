### HDD patch classic & VDTCreator ###
######################################

This is HDD patch classic for MB-02+ (or MB-03+ Ultimate), based on Dron's
HDD patch v1.62. The purpose is to keep the patch alive for people who do not
like EasyHDD.


=== Features ===

- supports master & slave devices
- support CHS & LBA access
- DMA transfers (Zilog DMA compatible)
- diskimage capacity: 2MB (2,097,152 bytes)
- diskimage format: trk = 1..255
                    sec = 2..16
- extended partitions are NOT, and will not be supported
- VDT combined from both master and slave devices is NOT supported yet in
  VDTCreator, but it is planned in future versions.


=== How to ===

With linux 'fdisk' or 'cfdisk' create partition type 47h on your CF card
or HDD. It should be not bigger than ~503MB. You can use also 'zxfdisk' for
this operation, which you can also find in distribution.

Place all tools to the same directory. Then run 'VDTCreator', and follow
onscreen instructions. The VDT will be created automatically, and then it
will be saved on disk. After that you can quit VDTCreator.

Now simply run 'HDPclassic', which installs HDD patch automatically. Safe
option is to make .KILL command and reset the computer with NMI+E.

If you need to start it automatically, put the 'HDPclassic' to 'autoexe'.

Then the new virtual drives have to be formatted. Use attached ff17 (F02-V34)
formatter tool, as the old ff17 (F02-V30) is not compatible with hdd patch.
You can combine 'trk' and 'sec' parameters freely, but the result of geometry
must be 2048 sectors in maximum. The widely used standard is 127x8, but you
can use other formats, e.g. 93x11, 64x16, 128x8, 113x9 etc. The recommended
formats are 127x8 or 93x11. Standard floppy formats are supported too, but
the unformatted space will be not used.

There are both versions of all tools attached, with PVL ports, and Dron ports.
ff17 (F02-V34) is port independent, and can be used also for floppy drives as
usual.
